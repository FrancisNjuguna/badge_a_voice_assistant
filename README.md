## Installation 
Installing Python Voice Assistant is easy and straightforward. All you need is a computer running Windows, MacOS, Linux or Raspberry Pi OS and an internet connection. To get started, follow these steps: 

 1. Download the latest version of Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). 

 2. Install the downloaded version of Python on your computer following the instructions provided by the installer program.

 3. Download the latest version of Python Voice Assistant from [GitHub](https://github.com/python-voice-assistant/python-voice-assistant).

 4. Unzip the downloaded file and run `setup_pva` in the terminal window to install all necessary dependencies for running the program on your system (this may take several minutes).

 5. Once all dependencies are installed successfully, run `pva` in the terminal window to start using your new voice assistant!

 6 (Optional). If you want to customize your experience further, you can edit `configuration_file` located in `~/.pva/configuration_file`. This file contains all settings related to how your assistant behaves when responding to commands or requests from users (e.g., what language it speaks in). You can also add custom commands here if desired!  

 ## Usage 
Using Python Voice Assistant is simple and intuitive - just speak into your microphone and it will respond accordingly! Here are some examples of things you can do with it: 

 - Ask questions about topics such as weather or news headlines (e.g., “What’s the weather like today?”) 
 - Set reminders for yourself (e.g., “Remind me to call my mom tomorrow at 10am”)  
 - Play music from streaming services like Spotify or Apple Music.
 
 and more.
